# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
---
Using data of kickstarter campaign from 2009 to 2017 to identify the best time to start a campaign and goals that were successful.  

### Purpose
---
A friend of mine, Louise had a successful fundraising campaign for her play “Fever”.  Thinking about starting a new campaign, 
she wanted to know how different campaigned fared based on their launch date and how campaigned fared to the outcome of their goals. 

### Analysis and Challenges
---
Using a large dataset provided for kickstarter campaigns, I used advanced functions within Excel.  I had to create new data 
elements from the provided data, then use pivot tables to splice the correct data to focus on theater and plays among the many 
different groups source within the data.  Then applying different excel formula to formulate some analysis before visualizing 
the data using excel charts.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
Reviewing the Kickstarter data, the best months to start a theater campaign would be May-July with May having the most success
of launching 111 successful fundraising starts.  May also has the highest number of failed campaign, but making up less than half
the total successful fundraising campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---
Reviewing the Kickstarter data, plays with a smaller goal amount are more likely to be successful meeting their campaign goals.  
AT $15,000 to $19999 is where the success and failed campaign are evenly split with 50% becoming successful or failed.  
Of note, there were not any canceled campaign in the data from 2009 to 2017.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
---
I didn't have many difficulties, but did have to identify a few issues with my graphs and making sure the goal ranges 
had the correct data splices.

### Results
---
Based on analysis from kickstarter data, campaigns were more successful than failed except for December which were nearly 
the same at 37 successful vs 35 that failed.  May thru July had the most successful campaign totals with May having 111 successful 
outcomes, over twice the number of failed campaigns at 52 

Many of the campaign with less that $15,000 fund raising goals were successful.  As the campaign goals increase beyond, they 
become less successful until reaching greater than $35000 as the goal.  There are 960 total campaigns during the timeframe 
of 2009-2017 that were less than $15000 but only 9 campaigns with a goal of $35000 to less than $45000, so the data is smaller.  
Campaigns greater than $45000 were mostly unsuccessful.  

Additional analysis that would be helpful is how many days each campaign was open, the number of people that contributed 
to the campaign and the average contribution with the same goal range.  This would help understand if the campaign that were 
successful had similar contributions or if the number of contributors increase with the high successful goals reached.
